- React was introduced for solving the phantom message problem, due ot which it got hate initially since for solving simple problems it made a new library itself

- Khan Academy and unsplash implemented react for the first time and their technical team preached it a lot

- React basically makes sure to change the DOM according to the changing state of the application, basically it helps in managing big frontEnd applications which is hard when using other frameworks like jQuery or Backbone.js etc

- React is a library which gives you freedom to work on your project in any way, on the other hand framework comes with strict rules about naming conventions of variables and etc.

- After React we learn react-router since react doesn't provides router, and then we handle state management through different libraries like redux, zustand
