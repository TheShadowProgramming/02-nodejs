- creating react apps is generally done with vite bundlers which are less bulky when compared to npx [react-dom for web, react-native for app-dev]

- off-topic :- scripts of a package help you to execute different operations on the project like start, build, test and eject

- as the name suggests, start will help you to see your project and run it locally in your browser, and when the code is ready for production then you use the build command (npm run build) to convert the react code into html/CSS/js
