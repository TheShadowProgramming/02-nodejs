# React + Vite

Here, I'll write the working of inner working of vite package which is light weight in nature

- in order for react to work in browser, it uses react-DOM, react-native is used in case of mobile apps

- there are 2 jsx (javascript-extension) files which are linked to each other, app.jsx has defition of function which returns a html according to the changing state of the application

- main.jsx renders the output of the app.jsx aaccording to the change in actual DOM and the virtual DOM that is created through react-DOM

- in npx react app, there were scripts tags which used to infuse the javascript generated by react at the time of production of the app, in case of vite bundler the main.jsx is already linked to the index.html which will render the website
