## Todo App

[files from "files" directory are kind of acting like a database, "App" directory contains the todo app's server,"node modules" directory contains libraries and other testing libraries from assignment which I'll use in future to write tests for the code]

In this repo, I've listed down my todo app's backend which consists of these features :-

- backend is built in javascript using node.js and express.js library
- global catches and several try-catch blocks for security
- I've included zod library for input validation
- I'm using jwt bearer token for authentication using middleware functions

### Future add-ons

- I'm learning Mongo.DB it'll be my noSQL database for the project, once I learn mongo.DB then I'll make a new app altogether since I want to make sure that this version of the app is visible to me where I'm storing the data in JSON file (I want something to feel nostalgic about when reviewing the code after 5-10 years)
- I'm learning react and will make a frontend of app
- data from the backend will be fetched using axios library
- tailwind CSS will be used to style the website

### that would be it and this will become my first MERN app, though the idea to choose a todo app as your first portfolio project seems stupid but I think the way I write code matters more than what I'm coding, I'll try my best to learn about the best industrial practices and include them here in the project and make my code more readable, collaborative, and ready for production
